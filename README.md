# Equity_model_example
This repository contains a notebook that uses the Python module "tabula" to scrape financial data from company reports/pdfs.

We then use that data to crate a full equity model with forecasts and valuation capability.

However it is not to be used to form the basis of an investment thesis, only as a working example case.
